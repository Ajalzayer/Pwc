# LLM Model Evaluation Project

## Overview
This project provides a web interface for querying multiple large language models (LLMs) and retrieving the best response based on vector search results. The system integrates various LLMs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMA-2, and Falcon, and uses Pinecone for efficient vector search.

## Features
- Real-time response streaming using Websockets.
- Integration with Pinecone for vector search.
- Querying multiple LLMs to find the best response.
